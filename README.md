# Predicting_sensor_faliure
The problem being addressed is of a semi-conductor manufacturing process. We plan to build a
predictive classification model for fault detection(yield failure) with the response being simple Pass or
Fail during the manufacturing process using classification.
Semi-Conductors are very widely used and almost all OEMs and electronics companies would care for a
problem like this.
The Solution will help predict a failure using the sensor parameters and various other inputs

The analytics problem being solved is Prediction of a binary response i.e. Classification. The inputs are in
the form of sensor variables and parameters.

We will be using the SECOM dataset from the UCI website. It has 591 attributes and 1567
observations(rows) (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/secom)
